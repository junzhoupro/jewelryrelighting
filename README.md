# Jewelry Relighting: Relighting Jewelry via Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models
Author: Jun Zhou

## Overview

This project implements a novel jewelry relighting system using a dual-UNet architecture with ControlNet integration. The solution enables photorealistic relighting of jewelry images under various HDR environments while maintaining fine details through edge preservation.

## Key Features

- **Dual-UNet Architecture**: Two UNet networks working together for enhanced detail preservation
- **ControlNet Integration**: Canny edge ControlNet maintains precise jewelry contours during relighting
- **HDR Processing**: Utilizes logarithmically normalized HDR maps for realistic lighting transfer
- **Efficient Fine-tuning**: Adapted from MimicBrush framework for resource-efficient training

## Code
